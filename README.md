# Dice-Rolling
For D&amp;D 
It's first programing challenges solution
The first number is the number of dice to roll, the d just means "dice", it's just used to split up the two numbers, and the second number is how many sides the dice have. So the above example of "3d6" means "roll 3 6-sided dice". Also, just in case you didn't know, in D&D, not all the dice we roll are the normal cubes. A d6 is a cube, because it's a 6-sided die, but a d20 has twenty sides, so it looks a lot closer to a ball than a cube.
